      <h6 class="docs-header">Our Services</h6>
      <p>IBSEC ensure our Healthcare and Engineering clients get what they want, to the highest standard, first time, whilst saving time and money. We do this by providing advice, design support, M&E services</p>
      <p>The National Health Service is currently facing its biggest challenge, with respect to funding, higher standards of care and expectations. The demand on the service is ever increasing, from an ageing population, in existing buildings with ageing plant and backlog maintenance issues. In addition to this, the number of well trained and experienced NHS Estates officers are dwindling, often without replacement and young engineers are not being trained.</p>
      <p>IBSEC have worked closely with a number of trusts for many years, filling the gap created by the above conditions. In conjunction with these clients, Plant replacements which traditionally would be carried out by Senior Estates Officers are often carried out by IBSEC. Recently, IBSEC have carried out turnkey plant replacement schemes for:- Air Handling Plant, Chillers, Steam Boiler, Hotwell, Vacuum Plant, Plate Heat Exchangers / Calorifiers, Switchgear, Transformers, Generators, Oil storage tanks, Ring Main Units. All the above schemes were compliant with HTM standards and carried out with minimum disruption to service, complying with CDM2015, Trusts Site rules and Financial Standing Instructions.</p>
      <p>IBSEC ensure that continued clinical care can be delivered and services provided during any project by taking into account the facilities available, the flow of patients and staff, and the programmed completion of work by builders to ensure return visits by contractors or changes due to operational changes not envisaged.</p>
      <p>We are particularly experienced in ensuring our NHS clients “get what they pay for” from their contractor. We are able to guide clients through their contract both commercially and technically.</p>

      <h6 class="docs-header">Engineering Philosophy</h6>
      <p>We believe that Engineering is an approach that defines and interprets our customer needs and the functionality they desire early within the project. Our Engineering considers the complete project, problem and/or operation and views modern systems and installations holistically so they perform correctly.</p>
      <p>IBSEC’s holistic engineering view ensures that aspects of selection and procurement, delivery, installation, support through operational phases, maintenance and eventual decommissioning and disposal are designed and incorporated at concept or replacement stages to reduce the life cycle costs for our clients</p>
      <p>We use our engineering backgrounds, experience and commercial awareness with our design skills to ensure we get it right for you by working with authorities, end users, external designers and contractors. By engaging IBSEC, we deliver value for money, resilient and functional buildings with fewer variations leaving you with time and money to use elsewhere.</p>
      <p>IBSEC review existing M&E services / infrastructure and conduct surveys prior to the undertaking of capital works to ensure that sustainable development is planned and inspect systems where a building is not functioning as expected by a client. IBSEC has experience working with many NHS Trusts to develop strategic vision to enable efficient site development. </p>
      <p>IBSEC is committed to the protection of the environment and promotion of sustainable development. We endeavour to minimize the environmental impact of business activities and to positively influence those we work with to ensure that sustainable technologies are successfully and cost-effectively integrated into any project.</p>

      <h6 class="docs-header">Design</h6>
      <p>IBSEC have a wealth of experience in design that range from specifying the requirements of a complete building, a whole floor, a suite in a department down to a single room.</p>
      <p>Our experience draws on knowledge and understanding of functionality, identifying key adjacencies, accommodating flows of work and people and ensuring all the environmental requirements are met.</p>
      <p>IBSEC has experience in appraising sites, master planning, and drawing production.</p>
      <p>We believe that the successful design of a project is produced by the development of relationships between consultant and client. IBSEC have a proven record of establishing, developing and maintaining honest, secure relationships with clients that enrich design and maximise the value for the client on every project.</p>
      <p>IBSEC are very proud of their reputation and take enormous pleasure when asked to return and work on new projects with satisfied clients. </p>
