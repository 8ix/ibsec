    <p>IBSEC ensure our Healthcare and Engineering clients get what they want, to the highest standard, first time, whilst saving time and money. We do this by providing advice, design support, M&E services</p>
    <p>The National Health Service is currently facing its biggest challenge, with respect to funding, higher standards of care and expectations. The demand on the service is ever increasing, from an ageing population, in existing buildings with ageing plant and backlog maintenance issues. In addition to this, the number of well trained and experienced NHS Estates officers are dwindling, often without replacement and young engineers are not being trained.</p>
    <p>IBSEC have worked closely with a number of trusts for many years, filling the gap created by the above conditions. In conjunction with these clients, Plant replacements which traditionally would be carried out by Senior Estates Officers are often carried out by IBSEC. Recently, IBSEC have carried out turnkey plant replacement schemes for:- Air Handling Plant, Chillers, Steam Boiler, Hotwell, Vacuum Plant, Plate Heat Exchangers / Calorifiers, Switchgear, Transformers, Generators, Oil storage tanks, Ring Main Units. All the above schemes were compliant with HTM standards and carried out with minimum disruption to service, complying with CDM2015, Trusts Site rules and Financial Standing Instructions.</p>
    <p>IBSEC ensure that continued clinical care can be delivered and services provided during any project by taking into account the facilities available, the flow of patients and staff, and the programmed completion of work by builders to ensure return visits by contractors or changes due to operational changes not envisaged.</p>
    <p>We are particularly experienced in ensuring our NHS clients “get what they pay for” from their contractor. We are able to guide clients through their contract both commercially and technically.</p>
